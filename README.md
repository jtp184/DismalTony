# Dismal Tony

Dismal Tony is a gem I created that forms the framework for a system by which you can script human-language commands into actions with the Ruby programming language, using a Conversational Agent (called a "VI", or Virtual Interface). 

This Gem sets up a set of defaults, and a methodology that allows you to easily drop new commands into your workflow, and have the VI execute them easily. I designed it to be friendly and fun to engage with, while at the same time supporting all of Ruby's programming capability, to allow it to handle complex tasks with ease.
